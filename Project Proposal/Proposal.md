## Project Overview

### Topic and Domain
  - goal and objectives
  - intended users
  - relevance (why is this interesting, and what contributions does it make)

### Background
  - existing systems that perform similar tasks or use related technology
  - identification of the main methods, technologies, and tools to be used

### System and User Requirements
  - main functionalities of the system (what does the system do)
  - main user interaction requirements (how is the system used)
  - main non-functional requirements (e.g. performance, hardware/software needs, privacy, security)
  - evaluation criteria for the above requirements (how can an evaluator determine that the implementation of system meets the requirements)

### Experiments
The application will run on Android version 4.4 and above
  - examination of how the system works in an environment that is as close as possible to the intended use
  - expected outcomes of the experiments

### Schedule

#### Monthly Plan For the Project

| Month  | Tasks |
| ------ |:-----:|
|January |Brainstorming and research on the available technology|
|February|Design and plan the implementation for the app. Implement the key features in the app |
|March   |  Testing the integration and public the app for alpha version   |
|April   |   
|May     |

  - weekly or biweekly plan for the first quarter
  - monthly plan for the whole duration of the project
  - milestones that identify critical steps towards the completion of the system

Not all of the above may apply for every specific project, but even if it does not appear in your project description, you should at least have thought about it.
It's fine with me if your description is longer than two pages. Your final report for the project will have to contain a lot of this information anyway, so if you can do much of it in advance, you'll benefit from it later.
